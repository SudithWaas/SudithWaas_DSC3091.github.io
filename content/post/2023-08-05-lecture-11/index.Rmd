# STATISTICAL QUALITY CONTROL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction

-   Quality is the degree to which products or services meet the needs of customers.

-   Common goals for quality professionals include reducing defect rates, manufacturing products within specifications, and standardizing delivery time.

-   Advantages of quality control

    -   Reduction in production/inspection cost

    -   Prior fault detection

    -   Satisfaction of consumers

-   Can be conducted as

    -   A part of production process,

    -   A part of last-minute quality control check

    -   A part of eventual check by quality control department
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Methods of Quality Control

-   Cause and effect diagrams

-   Control charts

-   Check sheet

-   Histograms

-   Pareto charts

-   Scatter diagrams

-   Stratification
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Process Capability Analysis

-   Measure whether consumer specified upper and lower specification limits (LSL/USL) are compatible with process control limits (LCL/UCL)

-   Cp (Process Capability Ratio): measure related to the spread of a process.

-   Cpk (Process Capability Index): measure related to the centerness of a process.

-   Centered processes are analyzed based on their Cp ratio while non-centered processes are analyzed based on their Cpk index.
