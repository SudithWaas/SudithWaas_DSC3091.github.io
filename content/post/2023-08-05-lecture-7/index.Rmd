# CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Categorical Data

-   A categorical variable has a measurement scale consisting of a set of categories.

-   Examples:

    -   choice of accommodation: house, condominium, and apartment.

    -   political ideology: liberal, moderate, or conservative.

    -   Gender: male and female

-   Categorical variables can be classified as Binary, Nominal or Ordinal.

-   Probability distributions for categorical data:

    -   Binomial distribution

    -   Multinomial distribution

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test

-   A statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether a variable is likely to come from a specified distribution or not.

-   In Knee injuries dataset, let's check whether the patients were randomly allocated to the treatment and placebo groups.

    -   Null hypothesis: $P_{trt} = P_{plc} = 0.5$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chi-Square Test of Independence

-   A hypothesis test used to determine whether two categorical or nominal variables are likely to be related or not

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assumptions of Chi-Square Test

-   Expected frequencies are sufficiently large.

    **If this assumption is violated**

    If your expected cell counts are too small, check out the Fisher exact test.

-   observations are independent.

    **If observations are not independent**

    It may be possible to use the McNemar test or the Cochran test.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fisher Exact test

-   The Fisher exact test works somewhat differently to the chi-square test (or in fact any of the other hypothesis tests)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mcnemar test

-   Suppose we want to check whether the two variables R2 and R3 are independent or not.

-   Here, both variables measure the pain of the same set of patients after the treatment.

-   Therefore, these observations can be correlated

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### kendall Rank Correlation

-   Kendall rank correlation is used to test the similarities in the ordering of data.

-   A better alternative to Spearman correlation (non-parametric) when your sample size is small and has many tied ranks.

-   Example: Customer satisfaction (e.g.Â Very Satisfied, Somewhat Satisfied, Neutral.) and delivery time (\< 30 Minutes, 30 minutes - 1 Hour, \>2 Hours)
